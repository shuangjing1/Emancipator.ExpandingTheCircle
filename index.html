                <p class="graph">For everything from non-violent drug offenses to homicide, the U.S. justice system has one broad tool to address crime: incarceration. The U.S. prison population has thus ballooned exponentially. According to The Sentencing Project, there are 2 million people in U.S. prisons and jails, a 500% increase over the last 40 years. The U.S. accounts for 5% of the global population but more than 20% of the worldâ€™s prison population, according to the Amedrican Civil Liberties Union.</p>
